solutions to Stanford ufldl tutorial new version
## Tutorial Homepage: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/
As far as I know, there's no complete version of solution to the new UFLDL tutorial,
while some content remain almost the same, a lot more differs a lot.
According to the documentation of the original files, some comments still refer to the old version,
maybe the new tutorial is still in develop.
Forks and pull requests are welcomed.
Enjoy it.
